Research Summaries
=====
As I publish and get involved in more projects, I will be updating this page. For now, feel free to browse through the high-level concepts of some of my works.

Electron Microscopy
=====
A basic introduction to the concept of electron microscopy.

Focused Ion Beam (FIB)
=====
I use FIB for TEM sample prep, but this video shows a broad overview on all the possible uses of FIB.

Change Detection
=====
In order to predict kinetic reaction mechanisms, we need to understand the motion and change in size of the samples observed. This video gives a good summary of the basic concepts of change detection, which we then adapt to our physics-regularized ML model.
