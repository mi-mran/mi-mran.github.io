My research revolves around transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB) and applying machine learning (image segmentation) techniques to understand kinetic reaction mechanisms. I have a general interest in the application of machine learning toward improving microscopy workflows and the intersection between materials science and image-based data.
